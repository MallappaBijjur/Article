Problem Statement
 React JS /Javascript - Create UI for the above Article API's.
 - two screens, one for creating the articles and one for listing the articles.

 - in the articles list page itself user should be able to vote for a particular article and should be updated on the back end.

 - minimal UI would be sufficient and can use any CSS framework of your choice if required.

 

Stack:

 - Any front end framework (Ember would be an added advantage)

 - Use any JS package/library that is require
